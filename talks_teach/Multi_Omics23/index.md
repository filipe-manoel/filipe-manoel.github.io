### 1. Introduction
This course was intended for research scientists from the private sector and public institutions interested in learning the foundations of different prediction frameworks considering the integration of multiple omics of information (or layers) with applications in plant and animal breeding. The course will demonstrate the development and utilization of prediction models in plant breeding programs and how to implement these at different stages of the breeding pipeline. The effort was put together by Prof. Diego Jarquin, from Florida University. I was invited to give three topics, as below demonstrated.
