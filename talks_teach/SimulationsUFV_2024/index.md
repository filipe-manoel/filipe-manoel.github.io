# **Introduction**

![Imputation](../../assets/images/Picture1.png){:width="45%" align="right"}  

Designing a breeding program is a complex task. It requires simultaneously considering multiple interdependent breeding objectives (costs, size, target traits, etc.). Towards this aim, simulations have been demonstrated as a powerful tool for auxiliary breeding decisions. One among several tools in simulations is the **AlphaSimR** package (Gaynor et al. 2021). The package uses stochastic simulations for the design and optimization of breeding programs. It offers a fast, simple, and inexpensive way to test alternative breeding programs.  
In addition, genomic selection is a tool that has been shown as a game changer in plant breeding. It has been used to optimize several steps of a breeding program, such as advancements, early selections, in-situ hybrid prediction, parent selection, cross-selection, and trait introgression, among others.  
Here, we gonna use both tools together (simulations and genomic selection) to guide discussions on how to optimize breeding programs.
