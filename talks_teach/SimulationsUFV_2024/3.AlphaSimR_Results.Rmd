## Introduction

As we recall from the first vignette, in a way to implement a set of simulations in the **AlphaSimR** package four steps must be followed:

1. Simulate founder genomes/haplotypes.
2. Set global simulation parameters for a target trait/traits.
3. Model the breeding program.
4. Examine results by looking into population individuals' metrics.

In this vignette, we will cover the last step of the simulation: examining the results. For such, we will compare two implementations over a few generations of selection.


We will start by loading the packages.


```{r}
# Loading packages
library(AlphaSimR)
library(ggplot2)

```


## Examine results over generations


```{r}
rm(list=ls())

# Creating the founding genome
founderGenomes = runMacs(nInd = 100,
                         nChr = 4,
                         segSites = 20,
                         species = "MAIZE")


# Setting up trait characteristics
SP = SimParam$new(founderGenomes)
SP$addTraitA(nQtlPerChr = 20, 
             mean = 10, 
             var = 1)

# Generating base population
basePop = newPop(founderGenomes)


# Set simulation parameters 
nSelected1 = 10 # Scenario 1
nSelected2 = 50  # Scenario 2

##------------------- For the first scenario
# Select the best performing individuals according to their phenotype
basePopSelected = basePop

# Allocate vectors
nGenerations = 10 + 1 # +1 to store starting generation
meanGAll = numeric(nGenerations)
varGAll = numeric(nGenerations)
corGAll = numeric(nGenerations)

# Save the starting values
meanGAll[1] = meanG(basePop)
varGAll[1] = varG(basePop)
corGAll[1] = cor(gv(basePop), pheno(basePop))

# To make the for loop below simpler we will make a copy of the object basePopSelected
newPopSelected = basePopSelected

# Selection over many generations
for (generation in 1:(nGenerations - 1)) {
  # Cross parents, phenotype progeny, and select new parents
  newPop = randCross(newPopSelected, nCrosses = nInd(basePop))
  newPop = setPheno(newPop, h2 = 0.5)
  newPopSelected = selectInd(pop = newPop,
                             nInd = nSelected1,
                             use = "pheno")
  # Save summaries
  meanGAll[1 + generation] = meanG(newPop)
  varGAll[1 + generation] = varG(newPop)
  corGAll[1 + generation] = cor(gv(newPop), pheno(newPop))
}

# Now save these outputs by copying the objects
meanGAll_n10 = meanGAll
varGAll_n10 = varGAll
corGAll_10 = corGAll
##------------------- For second scenario

# Allocate vectors
nGenerations = 10 + 1 # +1 to store starting generation
meanGAll = numeric(nGenerations)
varGAll = numeric(nGenerations)
corGAll = numeric(nGenerations)

# Save the starting values
meanGAll[1] = meanG(basePop)
varGAll[1] = varG(basePop)
corGAll[1] = cor(gv(basePop), pheno(basePop))

# To make the for loop below simpler we will make a copy of the object basePopSelected
newPopSelected = basePopSelected

# Selection over many generations
for (generation in 1:(nGenerations - 1)) {
  # Cross parents, phenotype progeny, and select new parents
  newPop = randCross(newPopSelected, nCrosses = nInd(basePop))
  newPop = setPheno(newPop, h2 = 0.5)
  newPopSelected = selectInd(pop = newPop,
                             nInd = nSelected2,
                             use = "pheno")
  # Save summaries
  meanGAll[1 + generation] = meanG(newPop)
  varGAll[1 + generation] = varG(newPop)
  corGAll[1 + generation] = cor(gv(newPop), pheno(newPop))
}

# Now save these outputs by copying the objects
meanGAll_n50 = meanGAll
varGAll_n50 = varGAll
corGAll_n50 = corGAll

```

Let's plot and see the changes over time


```{r}

par(mfrow = c(2, 1),
    mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))

# Plot mean of genetic values over time
meanRanges = range(c(meanGAll_n10, meanGAll_n50))
plot(x = 1:nGenerations, y = meanGAll_n10, type = "l", col = "black", lwd = 3,
     xlab = "Generation", ylab = "Mean of genetic values", ylim = meanRanges)
lines(x = 1:nGenerations, y = meanGAll_n50, type = "l", col = "purple", lty = 2, lwd = 3)
legend(x = "topleft", legend = c(10, 50), title = "nSelected",
       lwd = 3, lty = c(1, 2), col = c("black", "purple"), bty = "n")

# Plot variance of genetic values over time
varRanges = range(c(varGAll_n50, varGAll_n10))
plot(x = 1:nGenerations, y = varGAll_n10, type = "l", col = "black", lwd = 3,
     xlab = "Generation", ylab = "Variance of genetic values", ylim = varRanges)
lines(x = 1:nGenerations, y = varGAll_n50, type = "l", col = "purple", lty = 2, lwd = 3)
legend(x = "topright", legend = c(10, 50), title = "nSelected",
       lwd = 3, lty = c(1, 2), col = c("black", "purple"), bty = "n")
```
