## 1. Introduction
These three classes were conducted as part of the discipline Quantitative Genetics (PCB-6555) taught at the University of Florida in the Fall of 2022. It was taught by Prof. Márcio Resende and Prof. Felipe Ferrão, and I was invited to participate as a Teaching assistant. As part of it, I put some effort together to generate three topics, as below indicated.
