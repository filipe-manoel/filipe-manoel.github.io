	abstract = {Progress in the rate of improvement in autopolyploid species has been limited compared with diploids, mainly because software and methods to apply advanced prediction and selection methodologies in autopolyploids are lacking. The objectives of this research were to (i) develop an R package for autopolyploids to construct the relationship matrix derived from pedigree information that accounts for autopolyploidy and double reduction and (ii) use the package to estimate the level and effect of double reduction in an autotetraploid blueberry breeding population with extensive pedigree information. The package is unique, as it can create A-matrices for different levels of ploidy and double reduction, which can then be used by breeders to fit mixed models in the context of predicting breeding values (BVs). Using the data from this blueberry population, we found for all the traits that tetrasomic inheritance creates a better fit than disomic inheritance. In one of the five traits studied, the level of double reduction was different from zero, decreasing the estimated heritability, but it did not affect the prediction of BVs. We also discovered that different depths of pedigree would have significant implications on the estimation of double reduction using this approach. This freely available R package is available for autopolyploid breeders to estimate the level of double reduction present in their populations and the impact in the estimation of genetic parameters as well as to use advanced methods of prediction and selection.},

	abstract = {The global growing population is experiencing challenges to satisfy the food chain supply in a world that faces rapid changes in environmental conditions complicating the development of stable cultivars. Emergent methodologies aided by molecular marker information such as marker assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection (GS) have been widely adopted to assist the development of improved genotypes. In general, the implementation of GS is not straightforward, and it usually requires cross-validation studies to ﬁnd the optimum set of factors (training set sizes, number of markers, quality control, etc.) to use in real breeding applications. In most cases, these different scenarios (combination of several factors) vary just in the levels of a single factor keeping ﬁxed the levels of the other factors allowing the use of previously developed routines (code reuse). In this study, we present a set of structured modules that are easily to assemble for constructing complex genomic prediction pipelines from scratch. Also, we proposed a novel method for selecting training-testing sets of sizes across different cross-validation schemes (CV2, predicting tested genotypes in observed environments; CV1, predicting untested genotypes in observed environments; CV0, predicting tested genotypes in novel environments; and CV00, predicting untested genotypes in novel environments). To show how our implementation works, we considered two real data sets. These correspond to selected samples of the USDA soybean collection (D1: 324 genotypes observed in 6 environments scored for 9 traits) and of the Soybean Nested Association Mapping (SoyNAM) experiment (D2: 324 genotypes observed in 6 environments scored for 6 traits). In addition, three prediction models which consider the effect of environments and lines (M1: E + L), environments, lines and main effect of markers (M2: E + L + G), and also the inclusion of the interaction between makers and environments (M3: E + L + G + G×E) were considered. The results conﬁrm that under CV2 and CV1 schemes, moderate improvements in predictive ability can be obtained with the inclusion of the interaction component, while for CV0 mixed results were observed, and for CV00 no improvements were shown. However, for this last scenario, the inclusion of weather and soil data potentially could enhance the results of the interaction model.},

Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of firstand second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63\% compared with 32\% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3\%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66\%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required {\textless}1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.},

	abstract = {Genomic evaluation models can fit additive and dominant SNP effects. Under quantitative genetics theory, additive or “breeding” values of individuals are generated by substitution effects, which involve both “biological” additive and dominant effects of the markers. Dominance deviations include only a portion of the biological dominant effects of the markers. Additive variance includes variation due to the additive and dominant effects of the markers. We describe a matrix of dominant genomic relationships across individuals, D, which is similar to the G matrix used in genomic best linear unbiased prediction. This matrix can be used in a mixed-model context for genomic evaluations or to estimate dominant and additive variances in the population. From the “genotypic” value of individuals, an alternative parameterization defines additive and dominance as the parts attributable to the additive and dominant effect of the markers. This approach underestimates the additive genetic variance and overestimates the dominance variance. Transforming the variances from one model into the other is trivial if the distribution of allelic frequencies is known. We illustrate these results with mouse data (four traits, 1884 mice, and 10,946 markers) and simulated data (2100 individuals and 10,000 markers). Variance components were estimated correctly in the model, considering breeding values and dominance deviations. For the model considering genotypic values, the inclusion of dominant effects biased the estimate of additive variance. Genomic models were more accurate for the estimation of variance components than their pedigree-based counterparts.},

	abstract = {New methods that incorporate the main and interaction effects of high-dimensional markers and of high-dimensional environmental covariates gave increased prediction accuracy of grain yield in wheat across and within environments. In most agricultural crops the effects of genes on traits are modulated by environmental conditions, leading to genetic by environmental interaction (G × E). Modern genotyping technologies allow characterizing genomes in great detail and modern information systems can generate large volumes of environmental data. In principle, G × E can be accounted for using interactions between markers and environmental covariates (ECs). However, when genotypic and environmental information is high dimensional, modeling all possible interactions explicitly becomes infeasible. In this article we show how to model interactions between high-dimensional sets of markers and ECs using covariance functions. The model presented here consists of (random) reaction norm where the genetic and environmental gradients are described as linear functions of markers and of ECs, respectively. We assessed the proposed method using data from Arvalis, consisting of 139 wheat lines genotyped with 2,395 SNPs and evaluated for grain yield over 8 years and various locations within northern France. A total of 68 ECs, defined based on five phases of the phenology of the crop, were used in the analysis. Interaction terms accounted for a sizable proportion (16 \%) of the within-environment yield variance, and the prediction accuracy of models including interaction terms was substantially higher (17-34 \%) than that of models based on main effects only. Breeding for target environmental conditions has become a central priority of most breeding programs. Methods, like the one presented here, that can capitalize upon the wealth of genomic and environmental information available, will become increasingly important.},

	abstract = {Breeding for drought tolerance is a challenging task that requires costly, extensive, and precise phenotyping. Genomic selection (GS) can be used to maximize selection efficiency and the genetic gains in maize (Zea mays L.) breeding programs for drought tolerance. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of genomic selection (GS) using additive (A) and additive + dominance (AD) models to predict the performance of untested maize single-cross hybrids for drought tolerance in multi-environment trials. Phenotypic data of five drought tolerance traits were measured in 308 hybrids along eight trials under water-stressed (WS) and well-watered (WW) conditions over two years and two locations in Brazil. Hybrids’ genotypes were inferred based on their parents’ genotypes (inbred lines) using single-nucleotide polymorphism markers obtained via genotyping-by-sequencing. GS analyses were performed using genomic best linear unbiased prediction by fitting a factor analytic (FA) multiplicative mixed model. Two cross-validation (CV) schemes were tested: CV1 and CV2. The FA framework allowed for investigating the stability of additive and dominance effects across environments, as well as the additive-by-environment and the dominance-by-environment interactions, with interesting applications for parental and hybrid selection. Results showed differences in the predictive accuracy between A and AD models, using both CV1 and CV2, for the five traits in both water conditions. For grain yield (GY) under WS and using CV1, the AD model doubled the predictive accuracy in comparison to the A model. Through CV2, GS models benefit from borrowing information of correlated trials, resulting in an increase of 40\% and 9\% in the predictive accuracy of GY under WS for A and AD models, respectively. These results highlight the importance of multi-environment trial analyses using GS models that incorporate additive and dominance effects for genomic predictions of GY under drought in maize single-cross hybrids.},

In multi-harvest data analyses, one frequently observes heteroscedasticity and genetic/statistical imbalance, which requires adequate statistical methods. This study aimed to (i) compare multi-harvest models with homogenous and heterogeneous residual variance, (ii) define the optimal number of harvests for an accurate genetic selection of T. grandiflorum genotypes, and (iii) select T. grandiflorum hybrid families with high fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom using an additive index. We used a generalized linear mixed model to analyse the resistance to witches’ broom. The data refers to an unbalanced trial with 34 triple-cross hybrid families, arranged in a randomized complete block design. We evaluated these families throughout 9 consecutive harvest years regarding fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom. The variance components, genetic parameters and genotypic values were estimated/predicted through residual maximum likelihood/best linear unbiased prediction methodologies. The model with heterogeneous residuals had a better fit than the homogeneous model for the fruit yield trait, according to Akaike information criterion. The results attest to the genetic variability in the evaluated population. To select the best individual for the next breeding cycle, three harvests are enough for selecting accurately for fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom. For commercial release, nine harvests are necessary for both traits. We identified ten high-performance families regarding fruit yield and resistance to witches’ broom.},

  abstract = {Most traits of agronomic importance are quantitative in nature, and genetic markers have been used for decades to dissect such traits. Recently, genomic selection has earned attention as next generation sequencing technologies became feasible for major and minor crops. Mixed models have become a key tool for fitting genomic selection models, but most current genomic selection software can only include a single variance component other than the error, making hybrid prediction using additive, dominance and epistatic effects unfeasible for species displaying heterotic effects. Moreover, Likelihood-based software for fitting mixed models with multiple random effects that allows the user to specify the variance-covariance structure of random effects has not been fully exploited. A new open-source R package called sommer is presented to facilitate the use of mixed models for genomic selection and hybrid prediction purposes using more than one variance component and allowing specification of covariance structures. The use of sommer for genomic prediction is demonstrated through several examples using maize and wheat genotypic and phenotypic data. At its core, the program contains three algorithms for estimating variance components: Average information (AI), Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Efficient Mixed Model Association (EMMA). Kernels for calculating the additive, dominance and epistatic relationship matrices are included, along with other useful functions for genomic analysis. Results from sommer were comparable to other software, but the analysis was faster than Bayesian counterparts in the magnitude of hours to days. In addition, ability to deal with missing data, combined with greater flexibility and speed than other REML-based software was achieved by putting together some of the most efficient algorithms to fit models in a gentle environment such as R.},

  abstract = {Broad-sense heritability is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance that is attributable to an overall variance for the genotype. It is often calculated as a measure (i) to quantify and eventually compare the precision of agricultural cultivar trials, and/or (ii) to estimate the response to selection in plant breeding trials. In practice, most such trials are conducted at multiple environments (i.e., year–location combinations) resulting in a multienvironment trial (MET) with unbalanced data, as, for example, not all cultivars are tested at each environment. However, the standard method for estimating heritability implicitly assumes balanced data, independent genotype effects, and homogeneous variances. Therefore, we compared the estimates for broad-sense heritability computed via the standard method to those obtained via six alternative estimation methods (example codes: https://github.com/PaulSchmidtGit/Heritability). We did so by analyzing four cultivar METs, which all displayed a typically unbalanced data structure but differed in the genetic frameworks of their cultivars. Results indicate that the standard method may overestimate heritability for all datasets, whereas alternative methods show similar estimates per dataset and thus seem better able to handle this kind of unbalanced data. Finally, we show that to compare heritability estimates between different METs, genetic variance component estimates should be fixed to common values for both datasets.},

It is usually estimated on an entry-mean basis, since the phenotype is usually an aggregated value, as genotypes are replicated in trials, which stands in contrast with animal breeding and human genetics. When this was first proposed, assumptions such as balanced data and independent genotypic effects were made that are often violated in modern plant breeding trials/analyses. Due to this, multiple alternative methods have been proposed, aiming to generalize heritability on an entry-mean basis. In this study, we propose an extension of the concept for heritability on an entry-mean to an entry-difference basis, which allows for more detailed insight and is more meaningful in the context of selection in plant breeding, because the correlation among entry means can be accounted for. We show that under certain circumstances our method reduces to other popular generalized methods for heritability estimation on an entry-mean basis. The approach is exemplified via four examples that show different levels of complexity, where we compare six methods for heritability estimation on an entry-mean basis to our approach (example codes: https://github.com/PaulSchmidtGit/ Heritability). Results suggest that heritability on an entry-difference basis is a well-suited alternative for obtaining an overall heritability estimate, and in addition provides one heritability per genotype as well as one per difference between genotypes.},

  abstract = {The optimization of perennial plant breeding necessarily involves the evaluation of multi-harvest and/or multi-site trials. In these situations, modeling covariance structures can elevate accuracy. This study aimed to evaluate different covariance structures for multi-harvest and multi-site trial analyses, using two datasets (D1 and D2). In D1, 25 hybrids of Theobroma grandiflorum were evaluated in a complete randomized block design, during twelve consecutive harvest years. In D2, 215 clones of Eucalyptus spp. were evaluated in a complete randomized block design, in four sites. For both datasets, the covariance structures of the random effects were modeled, and their adequacy was tested by the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. From the selected model, the variance components and genetic parameters were estimated. We also compared the expected genetic gains and the rankings of genotypes based on the genotypic values provided by the basic and the selected models. For D1, the third-order factor analytic model was the most suitable for genetic effects, while for D2, the unstructured model showed the best fit for such effects. The models provided a better insight into the variances dynamics over the harvest years/sites. The genetic gains were 3.52 percentage points higher in D1 and did not change in D2. Despite similar results, the standard model, modeled with covariance structures that assume homogeneity of co-variances, was not the most statistically appropriate model for D2 according to the information criteria. Therefore, the modeling of covariance structures can and should be used in the genetic evaluation of perennial plants.},

When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

  abstract = {Breeding for drought tolerance is a challenging task that requires costly, extensive, and precise phenotyping. Genomic selection (GS) can be used to maximize selection efficiency and the genetic gains in maize (Zea mays L.) breeding programs for drought tolerance. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of genomic selection (GS) using additive (A) and additive\,+\,dominance (AD) models to predict the performance of untested maize single-cross hybrids for drought tolerance in multi-environment trials. Phenotypic data of five drought tolerance traits were measured in 308 hybrids along eight trials under water-stressed (WS) and well-watered (WW) conditions over two years and two locations in Brazil. Hybrids’ genotypes were inferred based on their parents’ genotypes (inbred lines) using single-nucleotide polymorphism markers obtained via genotyping-by-sequencing. GS analyses were performed using genomic best linear unbiased prediction by fitting a factor analytic (FA) multiplicative mixed model. Two cross-validation (CV) schemes were tested: CV1 and CV2. The FA framework allowed for investigating the stability of additive and dominance effects across environments, as well as the additive-by-environment and the dominance-by-environment interactions, with interesting applications for parental and hybrid selection. Results showed differences in the predictive accuracy between A and AD models, using both CV1 and CV2, for the five traits in both water conditions. For grain yield (GY) under WS and using CV1, the AD model doubled the predictive accuracy in comparison to the A model. Through CV2, GS models benefit from borrowing information of correlated trials, resulting in an increase of 40\% and 9\% in the predictive accuracy of GY under WS for A and AD models, respectively. These results highlight the importance of multi-environment trial analyses using GS models that incorporate additive and dominance effects for genomic predictions of GY under drought in maize single-cross hybrids.},

  abstract = {“Sparse testing” refers to reduced multi-environment breeding trials in which not all genotypes of interest are grown in each environment. Using genomic-enabled prediction and a model embracing genotype × environment interaction (GE), the non-observed genotype-in-environment combinations can be predicted. Consequently, the overall costs can be reduced and the testing capacities can be increased. The accuracy of predicting the unobserved data depends on different factors including (1) how many genotypes overlap between environments, (2) in how many environments each genotype is grown, and (3) which prediction method is used. In this research, we studied the predictive ability obtained when using a fixed number of plots and different sparse testing designs. The considered designs included the extreme cases of (1) no overlap of genotypes between environments, and (2) complete overlap of the genotypes between environments. In the latter case, the prediction set fully consists of genotypes that have not been tested at all. Moreover, we gradually go from one extreme to the other considering (3) intermediates between the two previous cases with varying numbers of different or non-overlapping (NO)/overlapping (O) genotypes. The empirical study is built upon two different maize hybrid data sets consisting of different genotypes crossed to two different testers (T1 and T2) and each data set was analyzed separately. For each set, phenotypic records on yield from three different environments are available. Three different prediction models were implemented, two main effects models (M1 and M2), and a model (M3) including GE. The results showed that the genome-based model including GE (M3) captured more phenotypic variation than the models that did not include this component. Also, M3 provided higher prediction accuracy than models M1 and M2 for the different allocation scenarios. Reducing the size of the calibration sets decreased the prediction accuracy under all allocation designs with M3 being the less affected model; however, using the genome-enabled models (i.e., M2 and M3) the predictive ability is recovered when more genotypes are tested across environments. Our results indicate that a substantial part of the testing resources can be saved when using genome-based models including GE for optimizing sparse testing designs.},

  abstract = {A good statistical analysis of genotype × environment interactions (G × E) is a key requirement for progress in any breeding program. Data for G × E analyses traditionally come from multi-environment trials. In recent years, increasingly data are generated from managed stress trials, phenotyping platforms, and high throughput phenotyping techniques in the field. Simultaneously, and complementary to the phenotyping, more elaborate genotyping and envirotyping occur. All of these developments further increase the importance of a sound statistical framework for analyzing G × E. This paper presents considerations on such a framework from the point of view of the choices that need to be made with respect to the content of short academic courses on statistical methods for G × E. Based on our experiences in teaching statistical methods to plant breeders, for specialized G × E courses between three and 5 d are reserved. The audience in such courses includes MSc students, PhD students, postdocs, and researchers at breeding companies. For such specialized courses, we propose a collection of topics to be covered. Our outlook on G × E analyses is two-fold. On the one hand, we see the G × E problem as the building of predictive models for genotype-specific reaction norms. On the other hand, the G × E problem consists in the identification of suitable variance-covariance models to describe heterogeneity of genetic variance and correlations across environments. Our preferred class of statistical models is the class of mixed linear-bilinear models. These statistical models allow us to answer breeding questions on adaptation, adaptability, stability, and the identification and subdivision of the target population of environments. By a citation analysis of the literature on G × E, we show that our preference for mixed linear-bilinear models for analyzing G × E is supported by recent trends in the types of methods for G × E analysis that are most frequently cited.},

Enfatizou também a necessidade do uso de métodos de estimação/predição de valores genotípicos que promovam shrinkage sobre a média fenotípica do cultivar; ou seja, que considerem um coeficiente de determinação genética, bem como a possível heterogeneidade de variâncias residuais entre as cultivares. Concluiu-se que, para atingir uma meta de acurácia de 90\%, os valores do teste F de Snedecor associados aos efeitos de cultivares, na análise da variância, devem ser superiores a 5,0. O uso da estatística F é uma alternativa para também levar em consideração o nível de variabilidade genética dos caracteres. Assim, não é suficiente fixar-se um número mínimo de repetições e um valor máximo para o coeficiente de variação experimental (CVe). Para caracteres de produção, em geral com baixo coeficiente de determinação genética, os números de repetições usualmente empregados (entre dois e quatro) não permitem atingir essa meta de acurácia seletiva, mesmo quando se perseguem valores de CVe inferiores a 10\% e a experimentação é realizada em vários locais e anos. Para isso, recomendam-se ao menos seis repetições na avaliação desses caracteres. Demonstra-se, ainda, que os estimadores/preditores que promovem shrinkage sobre a média fenotípica garantem inferências mais realistas e precisas acerca das médias genotípicas das cultivares, devendo ser encorajados.},

Distributions of data and effects, and dimension and structure of the models are considered for model selection and parameters estimation.

An analytical FML way of defining random or fixed effects is presented to avoid the subjective or conceptual usual definitions. Examples of the applications of the Hierarchical Maximum Likelihood/Hierarchical Generalized Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (HIML/HG-BLUP) procedure are also presented. Sample sizes for achieving high experimental quality and accuracy are indicated and simple interpretation of the estimates of key genetic parameters are given. Phenomics and genomics are approached.

In general, the well-known "coefficient of kinship" is not sufficient to solve the problem. It is necessary to use a more complete measure of kinship, the set of nine "condensed identity coefficients." This article reviews these coefficients and their use to establish equations which give the "genotype structure" (i.e. the set of probabilities of the various genotypes) of an individual, given the genotype of one of his relatives and the gene structure of the population. When the ancestry network is simple enough, these equations may be put in a form in which only the coefficient of kinship appears. But the conditions for such a simplification are restrictive: not only must both relatives not be inbred, but also the kinship between them must be unilineal.}
