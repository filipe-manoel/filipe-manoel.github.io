## 1. Introduction
Cross-Validation schemes are fundamental concept in plant breeding programs that uses Genomic selection as a tool to harness genetic gain. One important way to measure how good is your model is the implementation of cross-validation schemes (aka CV schemes). Following the proposition made by Jarquin et al (2018), they can be broken down into four types:

Here, I put some effort together to combine some scripts that implement those cross-validation schemes.

## 2. **How to Implement it**

The first step will be to organize the phenotypic information and create the partitions to the cross-validation scheme (CV). Generally, we can divide the phenotypic dataset into two:

Testing set: Population where the phenotype will be predicted based on the markers and in the information from the training set.

Training set: Population with the information that we use to calibrate the model.
