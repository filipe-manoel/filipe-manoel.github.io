Hi! My name is **Marco Antônio Peixoto**, a **Postdoctoral Associate** at the Sweet Corn and Genomics lab, working in collaboration with Professor Márcio Resende Jr. I recently graduated in genetics and breeding at the Federal University of Viçosa with a big focus on quantitative genetics. Here, I will share some papers, research projects, and codes from classes and short courses that I have developed over my career.
