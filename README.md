# My personal website:

# How to modify

1. Change '_data/navigation.yml' for add/delete tabs
2. If you add one, create a new .rd file and replace it.
3. Modify the top header of the .rd file in the field /permalink/ with the name of the tab that you added in step 1. This will ensure that you will have a connection to the website.
